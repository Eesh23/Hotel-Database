This project is focused on developing an application for e-Hotels. This project is designed to cater to five prominent hotel chains across North America, enabling real-time room booking for customers. The task encompasses various aspects of database design and implementation, including creating an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, forming a relational database schema, defining and enforcing constraints for database integrity, actual database implementation, data insertion, SQL modifications, implementing indexes, and developing a user interface (UI) for interaction with the database.

Key activities include:
1. **ER Diagram Creation**: Design an ER diagram that reflects the project's requirements, including entities for hotel chains, hotels, rooms, customers, and employees, among others.
2. **Relational Database Schema**: Translate the ER diagram into a relational database schema.
3. **Database Constraints**: Define primary keys, referential integrity constraints, domain constraints, and user-defined constraints to ensure database correctness.
4. **Database Implementation**: Build the database based on the schema and constraints defined.
5. **Data Insertion**: Populate the database with data for five hotel chains, ensuring a diversity of hotels, categories, and room capacities.
6. **SQL Modifications**: Facilitate insert, delete, and update operations through SQL queries and triggers, demonstrating at least four queries and two triggers.
7. **Indexes Implementation**: Create and justify the use of at least three indexes for optimizing database queries and updates.
8. **User Interface Development**: Design and implement a UI that allows users to search for, book, or rent rooms based on various criteria. The interface should also support data management for customers, employees, hotels, and rooms. A simplified direct implementation on the DBMS will account for 40% of this section's grade, translating to 12% of the total project grade.
9. **SQL Views**: Implement two specific SQL views for displaying the number of available rooms per area and the capacity of all rooms in a specific hotel.
